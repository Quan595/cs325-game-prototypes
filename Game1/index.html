<h2>Your game title</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
<br/>
- It's a golf game that is so unfinished and unintuitive that probably no one else has made yet.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
<br/>
- Players use left and right arrow key to move the ball (very unintuitive).
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
<br/>
- Creating objects are straight forward and phaser has a lot of useful built-in functions.
<br/>
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
<br/>
- The syntax to create objects are hard to remember, and it's hard to find the right assets for the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
<li>Golf Ball: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/photonstorm/phaser-examples/master/examples/assets/sprites/red_ball.png">ball</a></li>
<li>Ground: <a href="http://clipart-library.com/data_images/482762.gif">green rectangle</a></li>
<li>Background: <a href="https://winfishu.deviantart.com/art/Free-Sky-background-321975699">sky</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<br/>
- The closest game that resembles to mine is a game called Infinite Golf on mobile, but mine is a lot more simple.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.
<br/>
- Golf, get the ball in the hole.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
<br/>
- I chose golf as my theme.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
<br/>
- I chose to do left and right arrow keys as inputs to move the ball.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
<br/>
- Being able to use phaser to create objects in the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
<br/>
- Hoping they realize that making a game is hard and could take a long time to perfect.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
<br/>
- The players can perform a wide variety of actions like moving the ball left and right. Getting the ball in the hole means the player wins and the ball will bounce high in the air.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
<br/>
- Use the arrow keys to move the ball, but be sure to slow down when near the hole or the ball will just glide over it.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
<br/>
- The world is set in a golf course and the only movable object is the golf ball. The game starts out very calm, but it can get intense real quick.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
<br/>
- As many people as possible, this game is rated E for everyone.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
<br/>
- Roughly, from 2 seconds to 24 hours, depending on the player's skill.
</li>
